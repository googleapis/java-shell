 * <p>======================= CloudShellServiceClient =======================
 *
 * <p>Service Description: API for interacting with Google Cloud Shell. Each user of Cloud Shell has
 * at least one environment, which has the ID "default". Environment consists of a Docker image
 * defining what is installed on the environment and a home directory containing the user's data
 * that will remain across sessions. Clients use this API to start and fetch information about their
 * environment, which can then be used to connect to that environment via a separate SSH client.
 *
 * <p>Sample for CloudShellServiceClient:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * try (CloudShellServiceClient cloudShellServiceClient = CloudShellServiceClient.create()) {
 *   EnvironmentName name = EnvironmentName.of("[USER]", "[ENVIRONMENT]");
 *   Environment response = cloudShellServiceClient.getEnvironment(name);
 * }
 * }</pre>
